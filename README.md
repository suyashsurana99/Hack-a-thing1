#Hack-a-thing1

DESCRIPTION

This project contains a basic application created on android studio that runs on android smartphones. When it is run, the application will open up a window with a button in the center of the screen.
When the button is pressed, the sentence "Hack-a-thing: Hello World!" will be logged and will show up in the 'LogCat' tab on android studio. 


HOW TO RUN AND TEST THIS PROGRAM

To Run this application, one will require the following things downloaded:
1) Android Studio
2) Android Smartphone that can be plugged into the computer or an Android Emulator

Once you have these up and running, open the github project on Android Studio. Once the project is fully built (should take a minute or so), Click the Run 'Tab' in the Drop Down menu bar at the top of the screen. Then proceed to click 'Run app'.
A window will then open up asking you to 'Select Deployment Target'; select the android emulator you have downloaded (I use the Pixel 2 API 30 (Android 11, API 30)) and click OK. A makeshift phone screen should show up, and the application should show up on this screen. Click the Button
in the center of the screen, and check LogCat on Android Studio to see if "Hack-a-thing: Hello World!" was logged.
